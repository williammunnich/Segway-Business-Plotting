Tour Scraping and Visualization Project

This repository contains a set of tools for scraping tour information, processing the data, and visualizing it on an interactive map. The project is divided into three main components:
	1.	Data Collection: Scraping initial and detailed data from a website.
	2.	Data Processing: Producing comprehensive information from the scraped data.
	3.	Visualization: Creating an interactive map to display the tour data dynamically.

Getting Started

To begin working with the project, clone this repository and ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. The project uses Python for data collection and processing, and HTML/CSS for visualization.

git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-directory]

Workflow

	1.	Run the link_scraper_v2.py script to gather initial tour links. This script generates a CSV file containing valid links to tours.
	2.	Use the generated CSV file as input for comprehensive_scrape_v1.py. This script performs a detailed scrape of the tours and outputs a comprehensive CSV with additional metadata.
	3.	Feed the processed data into map_plot.py to generate an interactive HTML map (tours_map.html).
	4.	Optionally, use the index.html file for a professional website layout with the map embedded in an iframe.

Scripts Overview

1. Data Collection

File: scraper/link_scraper_v2.py
	•	Purpose: Scrapes valid links from a base URL by iterating through a range of IDs.
	•	Input: None.
	•	Output: A CSV file prefixed with scraped_tour_info_ followed by the current timestamp (e.g., scraped_tour_info_20241203_120000.csv).

How to Run:

python scraper/link_scraper_v2.py

2. Data Processing

File: scraper/comprehensive_scrape_v1.py
	•	Purpose: Reads the CSV generated by link_scraper_v2.py, performs detailed scraping of each link, and extracts metadata like title, location, company, website, and date information.
	•	Input: The CSV file generated in the previous step.
	•	Output: A detailed CSV file with comprehensive tour information.

How to Run:

python scraper/comprehensive_scrape_v1.py

You will be prompted to provide the input CSV file’s path.

3. Data Visualization

File: plotting_test_area/map_plot.py
	•	Purpose: Generates an interactive map of the tours using the processed data.
	•	Input: The processed CSV file (processed_data.csv).
	•	Output: An HTML file (tours_map.html) displaying the tours on a dynamic map with a timestamp slider.

How to Run:

python plotting_test_area/map_plot.py

Output

	•	tours_map.html: An interactive map showing tour locations with dynamic timestamps. Includes features like a boomerang effect on the time slider.
	•	index.html: A professional website template embedding tours_map.html in an iframe for improved presentation.

Future Enhancements

	•	Add error handling for scraping scripts to better manage network issues.
	•	Automate the integration of tours_map.html into index.html.
	•	Include additional metadata for richer visualization on the map.
