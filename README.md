# **Tour Scraping and Visualization Project**

This repository contains a set of tools for scraping tour information, processing the data, and visualizing it on an interactive map. The project includes a working professional file (`index.html`) that is ready to use, featuring a polished interface with an embedded map for showcasing tour data dynamically.

# 1. **Summary / Overview**

This project is divided into three main components:
- **Data Collection**: Scraping initial and detailed data from a website.
- **Data Processing**: Producing comprehensive information from the scraped data.
- **Visualization**: Creating an interactive map to display the tour data dynamically.

The project also provides a polished, ready-to-use `index.html` file featuring a seamless, user-friendly interface for visualizing the tour data dynamically.

---

# 2. **Working Professional File**

The project includes a ready-to-use `index.html` file designed for a polished user experience.  
Key Features:
- A professional layout.
- An embedded interactive map (`tours_map.html`) displayed seamlessly using an iframe.
- Clean design and user-friendly presentation.

To explore the functionality, you can open `index.html` directly in your browser without additional setup. This file is ideal for showcasing the results of your scraping and visualization efforts.

# 3. **Getting Started**

To begin working with the project, clone this repository and ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. The project uses Python for data collection and processing, and HTML/CSS for visualization.

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-directory]
```

# 4. **Workflow**

1. **Run `link_scraper_v2.py`**  
   - Gathers initial tour links and generates a CSV file containing valid links.

2. **Run `comprehensive_scrape_v1.py`**  
   - Uses the CSV generated in the previous step to perform a detailed scrape and outputs a comprehensive CSV with additional metadata.

3. **Run `map_plot.py`**  
   - Processes the data and generates an interactive HTML map (`tours_map.html`).

4. **Use `index.html`**  
   - A final polished file that embeds the generated `tours_map.html` for seamless visualization.

# 5. **Scripts Overview**

### **1. Data Collection**

**File:** `scraper/link_scraper_v2.py`  
- **Purpose:** Scrapes valid links from a base URL by iterating through a range of IDs.  
- **Input:** None.  
- **Output:** A CSV file prefixed with `scraped_tour_info_` followed by the current timestamp (e.g., `scraped_tour_info_20241203_120000.csv`).  

**How to Run:**
```bash
python scraper/link_scraper_v2.py
```

---

### **2. Data Processing**

**File:** `scraper/comprehensive_scrape_v1.py`  
- **Purpose:** Reads the CSV generated by `link_scraper_v2.py`, performs detailed scraping of each link, and extracts metadata such as title, location, company, website, and date information.  
- **Input:** The CSV file generated in the previous step.  
- **Output:** A detailed CSV file with comprehensive tour information.  

**How to Run:**
```bash
python scraper/comprehensive_scrape_v1.py
```
You will be prompted to provide the input CSV fileâ€™s path.

---

### **3. Data Visualization**

**File:** `plotting_test_area/map_plot.py`  
- **Purpose:** Generates an interactive map of the tours using the processed data.  
- **Input:** The processed CSV file (`processed_data.csv`).  
- **Output:** An HTML file (`tours_map.html`) displaying the tours on a dynamic map with a timestamp slider.  

**How to Run:**
```bash
python plotting_test_area/map_plot.py
```

---

# 6. **Output**

- **`tours_map.html`**: An interactive map showing tour locations with dynamic timestamps. Includes features like a boomerang effect on the time slider.  
- **`index.html`**: A professional website template embedding `tours_map.html` in an iframe for improved presentation. This file is ready to use immediately.

---

# 7. **Dependencies**

- `requests`  
- `beautifulsoup4`  
- `pandas`  
- `folium`  
- `concurrent.futures`

# 9. **Future Enhancements**

- Add error handling for scraping scripts to better manage network issues.  
- Automate the integration of `tours_map.html` into `index.html`.  
- Include additional metadata for richer visualization on the map.
